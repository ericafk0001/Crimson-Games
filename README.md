# The old version of Crimson Games

This has been archived because of multiple reasons, but the biggest one is not wanting to work around the code I made awhile back. 

This project *has not been abandoned*, the new version is at:
####**[Crimson Games](https://github.com/ericafk0001/Crimson_Games "Crimson Games")**



------------

P.S echo's games/cdns were used and they are down as of now and that is also a reason i'm remaking this project :tw-1f62c:
